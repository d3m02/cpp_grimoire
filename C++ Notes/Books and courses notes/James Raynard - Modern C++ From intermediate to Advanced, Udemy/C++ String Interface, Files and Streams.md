## C++ String Interface 
#### Initial note from cppreference 
In cppreference description provided for `std::basic_string`. In fact, it's template which depends on template argument create "different" string:

| Type                          | Definition                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `std::string`                 | `std::basic_string<char>`          |
| `std::wstring`                | `std::basic_string<wchar_t>`       |
| `std::u8string` (C++20)       | `std::basic_string<char8_t>`       |
| `std::u16string` (C++11)      | `std::basic_string<char16_t>`      |
| `std::u32string` (C++11)      | `std::basic_string<char32_t>`      |
| `std::pmr::string` (C++17)    | `std::pmr::basic_string<char>`     |
| `std::pmr::wstring` (C++17)   | `std::pmr::basic_string<wchar_t>`  |
| `std::pmr::u8string` (C++20)  | `std::pmr::basic_string<char8_t>`  |
| `std::pmr::u16string` (C++17) | `std::pmr::basic_string<char16_t>` |
| `std::pmr::u32string` (C++17) | `std::pmr::basic_string<char32_t>` |
|                               |                                    |
`::pmr` - polymorphic memory resource.

Beside that exists `std::basic_string_view` (with same tempalte-implementation idea) which contain some pretty identical member "r/o" functions (`find`, `contains`, `starts_with` etc)

In cppreference also used `ChartT`, `size_type` etc since examples taken from template functions and real type depends on string's template argument (`char`/`wchar_t`) etc.

### Searching Strings
* `find(const basic_string& str, size_type pos = 0)`, `find(const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0)`, `find(CharT ch, size_type pos = 0)` (signature mean that we can use either string of single char for searching) return index of first match after `pos`. If character not found `std::string::npos` will be returned
* There is `rfind()` member function that finds the last occurrence of its argument (function signature same);
* `find_first_of(const basic_string& str, size_type pos = 0)`, `find_first_of(const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0)` - find first occurrence of any character from the argument string
* Similarly for `find_last_of` - find last occurrence 
* `find_first_not_of`/`find_last_not_of` search for the first (last) occurrence of any character not in the argument

#### from cppreference 
* `find(const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count)` (and similar) - here looks like "search substring from s" (similarly to append), but in reality it's "find first `count` symbols from argument C-string `s` in original string starting from `pos`) ðŸ¤¦
* `find_first_of(CharT ch, size_type pos = 0)` equivalent to `find(CharT ch, size_type pos = 0)`; same thing with `find_last_of(CharT ch, size_type pos = npos)` == `rfind(CharT ch, size_type pos = npos)`
* `find_first_not_of(CharT ch, size_type pos = 0)` in general equivalent to `find_last_not_of(CharT ch, size_type pos = npos)` since with only 1 character we can check that it's not exists in string. It's also can be used to check that string contain only one exact character (although `find_last_not_of` search from end to begin, to check that symbol not found we compare with `std::string::npos` and not 0, since 0 is index of first character)  
```c++
std::string str{"aaaaa"};
if (str.find_first_not_of('a') == std::string::npos)
    std::cout << "all of them a!\n";
if (str.find_last_not_of('a') == std::string::npos)
    std::cout << "all of them a!\n";
```


### Adding Elements to String
* `append(const basic_string& str, size_type pos, size_type count)` - equivalent to `append(str.substr(pos, count))`, add substring to current string
* `insert(size_type index, const basic_string& str)`- insert string before `original_str[index]`
```c++
std::string str{"for"};
str.insert(2, "lde"s); // string is now "folder"
```
* `insert(size_type index, const basic_string& str, size_type s_index, size_type count = npos)` - insert substring `str[s_index, count)` 
* `insert(size_type index, size_type count, CharT ch)` - insert a char multiple times
* We can also use iterators, but remember that iterators can be invalid after modifying string (if allocation required after insert)
```c++
std::string str{"word"};
str.insert(std::prev(str.end()), 'l'); //str is now "world"

std::string str2{"ski"};
str2.insert(str2.end(), 2, 'l'); // str2 is now "skill"
```

### Removing Elements from Strings
* `erase()` takes two arguments - index of the first element to be erased and number elements to erase. For position of first element we can `find` (just remember to check that character exist) 
```c++
std::string str{"Hello"};
if (auto pos = str.find('e'); pos != std::string::npos)
	str.erase(pos, 2); // string now "Hlo"
```
* We can also use iterators. If use single iterator - it will erase the corresponding element, with iterator range - it will erase all elements in the half-closed range (`[begin, end)`)
```c++
str.erase(std::next(str.begin()), std::prev(str.end())); // Erase all character except first and last
```
* `replace()` will remove some of the characters from a string and replace them with other characters. The first argument is index of first character to be remove, the second argument is the number of character to be removed and the remaining argument give the characters that will be inserted 
```c++
std::string str{"Say Hello"};
str.replace(str.find('H'), 5 "Goodbye");
```
* Similarly to `erase()` we can use iterators. 
```c++
str.replace(str.begin(), str.begin()+3, "Wave"); // str now "Wave Goodbye"
```
* `assign()` can replace all the characters from a string with other characters

### Converting between Strings and Number
* `std::to_string` convert any numeric number to string.
* ` stoi (const std::string& str, std::size_t* pos = nullptr, int base = 10);` takes `std::string` argument and return it as an int. Leading whitespaces are ignored, but any non-number character terminate function.
```c++
std::string str{" 314 159"};
int val = std::stoi(str); // val = 314
```
* An optional second argument gives the number of character which were processed. If there is no errors, this is equal to the string's size, otherwise we get index of the first non-numeric character. _If the conversion fails completely, it throws an exception_
```c++
std::string str {" 123 "};
try {
Â  Â  size_t n_processed;
Â  Â  int val = std::stoi(str, &n_processed);
Â  Â  if (n_processed < str.size())
Â  Â  Â  Â  std::cout << "Processed only " << n_processed;
}
catch (std::invalid_argument e) {
Â  Â  std::cout << "Not a number\n";
}
catch (std::out_of_range e){
Â  Â  std::cout << "Can't fit into type";
}
```
* By default string is assumed to be decimal by default. An optional third argument gives the base (can be 2-36, 0 - the numeric base is auto-detected)
```c++
std::cout << std::stoi("2a", nullptr, 16); // will display 42
```
* For `double` can be used `std::stod()`, it's pretty same but don't have option to use different bases

#### cppreference 
Beside `std::stoi` and `std::stod` also exists 

| Returned type        | Function        |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `long`               | `std::stol()`   |
| `long long`          | `std::stoll()`  |
| `unsigned long`      | `std::stoul()`  |
| `unsigned long long` | `std::stoull()` |
| `float`              | `std::stof()`   |
| `long double`        | `std::stold()`  |
Strange that conversion to `unsigned int` not exists, one of theory is that it's due to size equality with `unsigned long` in most platforms (plus in some implementations range changed against `unsigned`)

### Miscellaneous String Operations
* `std::string` and `std::vector` have a `data()` member function, which return a pointer to the container's internal c-style memory buffer. For `std::string` this is null-terminated and equal to `c_str()`. It's useful for working with APIs written in C 
```c++
void print (int* array, size_t size);

std::vector<int> number {1, 2, 3, 4};
print(numbers.data(), numbers.size());
```
* `std::string` has `swap()`, which also implemented to support global `swap(T left, T right)` function.

### Character Functions
* C++ STL has a number of character functions which are inherited from C, these are defined in `<cctype>` and operate on `char`. 
	* `std::isdigit(c)` - returns `true` if `c` is a digit
	* `std::islower(c)` - returns `true` if `c` in lower case
	* `std::isupper(c)` - return `true` if `c` is upper case
	* `std::isspace(c)` - return `true` if `c` is a whitespace character
	* `std::ispunct(c)` - return `true` if `c` is a punctuation character
* `std::tolower()` and `std::toupper()` to convert to character case equivalent.

#### from cppreference
All of them take as argument `int` since function checks character ASCII code. Also in standard exist
* `std::isalnum()` - checks if a character is alphanumeric (numbers, lower and upper case letters)
* `std::isalpha()` - checks if a character is alphabetic (lower and upper case letters)
* `std::isxdigit()` - checks if a character is a hexadecimal character
* `std::iscntrl()` - checks if a character is a control character
* `std::isgraph()` - checks if a character is a graphical character (digits, letters, punctuation)
* `std::isblank()` - checks if a character is a blank character (`0x20` and `0x09`)
* `std::isprint()` - checks if a character is a printing character (isgraph + space)
