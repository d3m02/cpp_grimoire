This is collection of notes from books and courses

Those notes is mostly a combination of quotes, own researches/examples and rephrasing. In some cases it's shortened version without obvious or already known parts, but sometimes I added extra information or authors' interpretation of some basics or known parts. I tried to keep notes short yet consistent to use them during preparation for an interview.
