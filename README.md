# Behold not Mighty C++ Grimoire

>I really like the Idea that Magic is just a form of programming.
Like with programming. You use the right software, type the right words, use the correct syntax. And you have a program that does something
Similarly, with magic you string the right thoughts, chants, hand signs and materials together and you get a spell.
This explains wands, staffs and orbs as tools and shortcuts. No need for material components when your staff has phoenix feathers and feywild vines woven or a magic gem embedded into its tip.
The means that every wizard has a different way of going about casting or creating a spell.
And it opens up the very funny concept. Of spaghetti mages.
They don't know how half of the spell works. Their spellbooks are so incomprehensible and esoteric that its indecipherable to even expert wizards.
"Yes, I need to hold this potato while I cast magic Missile" "no its not the material component" "no the spell does not work without the potato"

Simply, this is my obsidian vaults with note which I make during C++ learning over ages. Initially notes was in docx file, however obsidian looks more flexible, faster, convenient (for code-style highlight for example), plus git allow to track activity.

Why take notes, especially for books or video materials - I see this as a hack for my mind. I get used to believe that I have great skills in problem solving through searching for information: I can filter information, skip lines of text, formulate search query - to achieve desired result for given problem. At the end, found information can hold in brain not long time, it's stored on _stack_ and destroyed after leaving the _scope_ of problem - when it's might require to solve problem once again - definitely same solution will be found once again. Such _runtime behavior_ makes learning a little bit challenging - information just _leak like a raw pointer_: reading some book or watching some conference video, utilize one repeated problem - finish (to get some new information) - brain can start to skip information/destruct to some other things etc. Adding in learning "quest list" notetaking set additional problem to solve during learning process - highlight important information, reinterpret it in more understandable way and also type it (which is third time in row repeating same information).   

Therefor, this vault is for track my learning amplitude and reinforce commits frequency, collect note for myself as footprint for quick reference in future
