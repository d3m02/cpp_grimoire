# Behold not Mighty C++ Grimoire 

![](Grimoire_pc_cover.png)

Simply, this is my obsidian vaults with note which I make during C++ learning over ages. I recently moved them from Docx file to Obsidian as experiment, will see how it's suitable for such task.

In general idea of this repository is simply sync that vault across my devices and also track progress. It's currently written on Russian, since it's helping a little bit to understand and memories something with self-translating to native language, though I plan to translate note in English as well as part of English practice.
